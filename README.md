The following python script was designed to tackle the challenge of password cracking. By implementing a
hashing algorithm known as SHA-1 and using a popular wordlist named “ROCKYOU.txt”. The main goal of this
script is to decode hashed passwords by systematically comparing them with precomputed hash values stored
in a data structure known as a rainbow table.” “
“ “The program employs the SHA-1 hashing algorithm to convert plaintext passwords into hashed
representations. Subsequently, a rainbow table is generated by iterating through a well-known wordlist,
"rockyou.txt." For each password in the wordlist, the program computes its SHA-1 hash and associates the hash
with the original password in a dictionary-like structure. The cracking process involves reading a file containing
SHA-1 hashed passwords, such as "Linkedin.txt," and attempting to match these hashes with their
corresponding plaintext passwords stored in the rainbow table. If a match is found, the program records the
result, including the original hash and password, in an output file named "newpasswords.txt."
