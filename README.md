â€œThe provided Python code defines a simple password cracker using a brute-force approach. The
PasswordCracker class takes a dictionary of potential passwords and attempts to crack a given SHA-256
hash by generating various combinations of words with added digits and symbols. The script begins by
initializing the class with the path to the dictionary file and lists of digits and symbols for password
variations. The dictionary is loaded into memory, and the generate_combinations method produces
different versions of each word by inserting digits and symbols at various positions. The
crack_password method iterates through the dictionary and generates combinations, calculating the
SHA-256 hash for each candidate. If a match with the target hash is found, the cracked password, the
number of attempts, and the time taken are returned. The main part of the script instantiates the
cracker, specifies the target dictionary path, and attempts to crack a specific hash, displaying the results
including the cracked password (if successful), the total attempts made, and the time taken for the
